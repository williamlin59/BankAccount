# BankAccount
This is a simple programme with an MVC design.  The middle-ware part(database) is implemented by MySql.
The controller part is implemented by Java. Our plan was to implement the view part by android GUI system. Unfortunately, due
to the time limitation we didn't actually get a chance to do so.

This programme allows user to open close bank account, deposite transfer cash. It also allows banker to withdraw cash, calculate interests
and froze account.

Design patterns include factory, mediator, observer, strategy, facede, rule object have been used during the implementation.
